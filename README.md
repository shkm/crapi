# üì† Crapi

Crapi [/Ààkrapi/] exposes a JSON or YAML file via a simple HTTP API for use as a basic read-only key-value store. It might be useful for serving up static data that doesn't change very often.

Also, it's written in Crystal! Yay!

‚ö†Ô∏è  Very WIP. Restructure and tests to follow.

## Installation

TODO.

1. Grab the binary
2. ???
3. Maybe profit

## Usage

With a `data.yml` file in the current working directory, run crapi:

```
crapi
```

Your yaml will be exposed on port 3000. For example, with this yaml file:

```yaml
foo:
  bar:
    baz: Hi ma
```

You'll receive this response:

```
> curl localhost:3000/foo/bar/baz
{"data":"Hi ma"}‚èé
```

If the key is missing, the server simply returns a 404.
